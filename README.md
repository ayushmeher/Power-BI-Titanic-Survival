# Titanic Survival Analysis

This repository contains analysis and predictive modeling for the Titanic Survival dataset from Kaggle. The project aims to understand the factors that influenced survival during the tragic sinking of the Titanic, using various statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A thorough analysis of data to understand the patterns and trends influencing survival.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data to prepare it for modeling.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building and tuning several machine learning models to predict survival outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy and performance of our models.
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is the Titanic Survival dataset available on Kaggle:
